                    <h4>Marvel Fantasy Battle will be an exciting web application that allows you to create your dream team and see how they fare against another worthy team.</h4>
                    <p>In this application you and your opponent will select your characters from list, alternating turns. Each selectable character from the list will have a set amount of draft points which they are worth according to their power, and both you and your opponent will have a set amount of draft points which you must not exceed. For example you may start off with 15 draft points. Some characters will be worth 2 points while others may be worth 5. You may wonder why not just select 3 strong players which are worth 5 points each. While it would be within the rules to do so, some characters can amp memebers of their team or buff opponents on the other team. So finding a team that compliments each other may be more beneficial than just strong individual characters. The location of battle will also be a factor. Along with selecting your teams they will also have to face off in different locations. Some characters may do better in certain environments than others. For example a team that has storm will have a massive advantage in an area surrounded by water or where is succeptable to other elements of nature. There will be many factors to determine the effectiveness of a character and in turn the team includidng strength, speed, close range combat, leadership, ability to fly, projectile ability, etc. An algorthm will determine the effective score. It's will be important to note that while a character may have their own score, their final score will also be dependant on who is on their team, or who is on the opponent's team. For example if Wolverine's individual score is 800, his score may drop to 200 if Magneto or another metal manipulator is on the opposite team.</p>
                    <p>Once all members of your team have been selected, the algorthm will take all these factors into account and display an effective team score. This score will determine a number of dice you will be granted to use. Your opponent will also have a certain number of dice generated based on their team score. You will then virtually roll the dice against your opponent to determine who wins that round. The winner has now aquired a point. The game will then randomly change the location and another round will begin using the same teams. You can go through as many rounds as you and your opponent agree on. In the end you will tally all the wins to determine which team came out victorious.</p>
                    <p>The Dice are important for two reasons. One because the game wouldn't be as fun if all you do was just pick the team and let the algorthm give you a score. Anyone can compare two numbers and note which one is higher. So part of it is to make it a little more exciting. The second reason is because even in a real battle there are variables and unforseen circumstances that allows a weaker team to beat a stronger team. Having dice represents those variables. However, a stronger team does have a better chance of winning so that's why they will have more dice than a weaker team, as generated by the team's total score. This is the essence of Marvel Fantasy Battle. It is currently in its early stages of development so look out for it coming soon!</p>
